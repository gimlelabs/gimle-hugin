  Monitor the folder {{ folder_path.value }} for new files.

  Start by calling check_folder with folder_path="{{ folder_path.value }}"
  and interval={{ heartbeat_interval.value }}.

  When new files are found, analyze their names and contents briefly.
  Then call sleep_until_next_check with the same folder_path and interval
  to resume monitoring.

  Keep monitoring until you decide there is nothing more to observe,
  then summarize everything you saw and call finish.
