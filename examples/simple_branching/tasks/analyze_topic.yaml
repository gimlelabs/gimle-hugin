description: Analyze a topic, spawning branches for follow-up questions
parameters:
  topic:
    type: string
    description: The topic to analyze
    required: false

  focus:
    type: string

prompt: |
  Analyze the following topic:

  Topic: {{ topic.value }}
  Focus: {{ focus.value }}

  As you analyze, you may encounter interesting follow-up questions.
  Use create_branch to explore these in separate branches - this keeps
  your main analysis clean while still exploring side questions.

  Example branches you might create:
  - "What are the employee perspectives on this?"
  - "How might this differ for different industries?"

  The branches will save their findings as artifacts for the user to see.

  Workflow:
  1. Begin your main analysis
  2. When you encounter interesting questions, use create_branch
  3. Continue your main analysis (branches run in parallel)
  4. Finish with your analysis
