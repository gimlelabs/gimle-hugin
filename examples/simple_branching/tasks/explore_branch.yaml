parameters:
  question:
    type: string
    description: The specific question to explore
    required: true
prompt: |
  You are exploring a question in a separate branch.

  Question to investigate: {{ question.value }}

  Review the context from the main branch, then investigate this question.
  Provide a clear, focused answer with your findings.

  When done:
  1. Use save_insight to save your answer as an artifact (this makes it
     visible to the user even though it's on a separate branch)
  2. Use finish with finish_type='success'

# Branch only has save_insight and finish - prevents recursive branch creation
tools:
  - builtins.save_insight:save_insight
  - builtins.finish:finish
