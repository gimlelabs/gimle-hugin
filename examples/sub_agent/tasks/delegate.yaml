prompt: 'You need to calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to {{ n.value | default(10)
  }}.


  Instead of calculating this yourself, delegate this work to a child agent.

  Use list_agents to see available agents, then use launch_agent to

  spawn a "child" agent to do the calculation.


  Once you receive the result from the child agent, report the final answer

  using the finish tool.
