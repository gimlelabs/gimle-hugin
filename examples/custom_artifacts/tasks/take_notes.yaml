description: Research a topic and create structured research notes
parameters:
  topic:
    type: string
    description: The topic to research
    required: true
  tags:
    type: array
    description: Default tags to apply to notes
    required: false
    default: []
prompt: |
  Research the following topic and create structured research notes:

  Topic: {{ topic.value }}
  {% if tags.value %}
  Default Tags: {{ tags.value | join(', ') }}
  {% endif %}

  Your workflow:
  1. First, query existing artifacts to see if we have prior research
  2. Research the topic using your knowledge
  3. Create 2-3 structured research notes using the save_research_note tool:
     - Give each note a clear, specific title
     - Write detailed content in markdown format
     - Add relevant tags (include the default tags if provided)
     - Set an appropriate confidence level (low/medium/high)
     - Include sources if you reference specific information
  4. Summarize what you documented and finish

  Create well-organized notes that would be useful for future reference!
