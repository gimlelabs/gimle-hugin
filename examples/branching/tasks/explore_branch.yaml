prompt: |
  You are exploring a specific solution approach.

  Problem: {{ problem.value }}
  Criteria: {{ criteria.value }}

  Your approach: {{ approach.value }}

  Explore this approach thoroughly:
  1. Analyze how this approach solves the problem
  2. Consider the trade-offs relative to the criteria
  3. Identify strengths and potential issues
  4. Provide your assessment

  When done, use the finish tool with your findings.

# Branch tasks only have finish - no branching tools to prevent recursion
