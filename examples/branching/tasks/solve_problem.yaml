description: Solve a problem by exploring multiple approaches in parallel
parameters:
  problem:
    type: string
    description: ''
    required: false
    default: Find the most efficient way to sort a list of 1 million integers
  criteria:
    type: string
    description: ''

    default: Balance between execution speed and memory usage
prompt: 'Solve the following problem by exploring multiple approaches in parallel:


  Problem: {{ problem.value }}


  Success Criteria: {{ criteria.value }}


  Follow your workflow:

  1. Analyze the problem and identify 2-3 distinct solution approaches

  2. Create a branch for each approach using create_branch

  3. Let each branch explore its solution independently

  4. Compare the results from all branches

  5. Provide your recommendation based on the criteria


  Remember: Each branch should explore ONE distinct approach!
