  Query artifacts for "{{ topic.value }}" and observe how ratings affect
  the results.

  Steps:
  1. Use query_artifacts to search for the topic
  2. Look at the results — rated artifacts include average_rating and
     rating_count fields, and higher-rated artifacts appear first
  3. Summarize the ordering: which artifacts ranked highest and why
  4. Finish with your observations about how feedback improves search quality
