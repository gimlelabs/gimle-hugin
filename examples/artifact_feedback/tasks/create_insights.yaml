  Research the topic "{{ topic.value }}" and save 3 distinct insights,
  each covering a different aspect of the topic.

  Steps:
  1. Query existing artifacts to see if we already have research on this topic
  2. Save 3 separate insights using save_insight, each as a focused markdown
     document covering a different angle (e.g. current state, challenges,
     future outlook)
  3. Finish with a summary of what you saved
