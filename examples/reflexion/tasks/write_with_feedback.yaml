description: Write an article using the Reflexion pattern with critic feedback
prompt: |
  Write an article about: {{ topic.value }}

  ## Instructions

  1. First, write an initial draft (300-500 words) covering the topic thoroughly.

  2. After completing your draft, use the launch_agent tool to get feedback.
     IMPORTANT: Include the full article text in the task_description parameter,
     as this is what the critic will see:
     ```
     launch_agent(
       config_name="critic",
       task_name="critique_article",
       task_description="Please critique this article:\n\n[YOUR FULL ARTICLE TEXT HERE]\n\nProvide: 1) Overall score (1-10), 2) Strengths, 3) Weaknesses, 4) Specific improvement suggestions"
     )
     ```

  3. Review the critic's feedback carefully. The critic uses a more powerful
     model to provide thorough analysis.

  4. Revise your article to address the feedback. Focus on:
     - The specific weaknesses identified
     - The recommended improvements
     - Preserving the noted strengths

  5. When you're satisfied with the quality, call finish with your final article.

  Remember: Good writing often requires revision. Be open to feedback and
  willing to make substantial changes when warranted.
