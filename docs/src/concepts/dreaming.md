# Dreaming — agents that wake up smarter

Dreaming is Hugin's offline **memory consolidation** loop. An agent runs
normally and saves what it learns as artifacts (episodic memory). Later, a
separate *dream* pass replays those scattered artifacts and distils them into
**`Learning` artifacts** — durable, prose lessons scoped to the config/task
that produced them. On the agent's next run, the relevant learnings are
injected straight into its system prompt.

No retraining; the agent improves by consolidating its own memory, the way
sleep turns the day's experiences into lasting knowledge.

```
  run  ──────▶  episodic memory  ──────▶  dream  ──────▶  learnings
   ▲            (insights it saved)    (consolidate)    (scoped to the config)
   │                                                          │
   └──────────────  injected into the next prompt  ◀──────────┘
```

## The three pieces

### 1. `Learning` artifact

A new artifact type that represents *semantic* memory — the consolidated
takeaway rather than the raw experience. It carries:

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `content` | The lesson, written as prose ready to drop into a prompt |
| `scope_config` / `scope_task` | Who the lesson applies to |
| `source_artifact_ids` | The episodic artifacts it was distilled from (evidence) |
| `supersedes` | Same-scope Learning IDs this lesson structurally retires |
| `confidence` | The dream's self-assessed confidence in the lesson |
| `derived_from` | Marker (`"dream"`) used to keep dreams from eating their own output |

It's registered alongside `Text`/`Code` and stored like any other artifact, so
the existing query/feedback machinery works on it for free.

### 2. The dream

A specialised Hugin agent that reads episodic artifacts grouped by their
producing `(config, task)`, finds patterns, and writes new `Learning` artifacts
back to storage. It runs offline, triggered by the `hugin dream` CLI command —
not as part of the hot path, so it never slows down a normal run.

The dream provenance-resolves artifacts by walking persisted agents *forward*
(each agent record holds its config and its ordered interaction UUIDs), so it
works **retroactively** on every artifact already in storage — not just ones
created after dreaming shipped.

The default dreamer works only from the selected episodic corpus and the prior
learnings supplied in its task. It can save a learning or finish; it cannot
search or fetch additional artifacts outside that evidence window. The corpus
selection budget is 120,000 characters, newest first (one oversized artifact is
still retained), and prior learnings and system instructions are additional
context. This is a corpus-selection limit, not a total token or dollar cap.

`max_steps` bounds interaction steps per scope, including model calls and tool
execution. It is not a count of model calls. Exhausting it before completion
emits a warning; a partial dream must not be interpreted as convergence merely
because it saved no new learning.

### 3. Render-time injection

The prompt renderer exposes a `{{ learnings }}` template variable. At render
time it fetches the `Learning` artifacts scoped to the current agent's config
(and current task, if scoped that narrowly), and substitutes them in. The
injected text is treated as a literal value, so a learning that happens to
contain `{{ … }}` is rendered verbatim rather than re-evaluated.

A template that doesn't reference `{{ learnings }}` is **byte-for-byte
unchanged** — opting in is local to a single template.

## Opting a config in

Add `{{ learnings }}` somewhere in your system template:

```yaml
# templates/assistant_system.yaml
name: assistant_system
template: |
  You are a personal travel concierge for one returning traveler.

  ## What you've learned about this traveler
  {{ learnings }}

  Whenever the traveler reveals a durable preference, record it with
  `save_insight` so you can serve them better next time.
```

On the agent's first run the section is empty. After a dream pass over its
saved insights, the next run renders something like:

```
## What you've learned about this traveler
- The traveler prefers window seats; book a window seat by default.
- The traveler is vegetarian; request a vegetarian meal by default.
```

## Running a dream

```bash
# Consolidate every config scope found in a storage path
uv run hugin dream --storage-path ./storage

# Just one config, without persisting (preview)
uv run hugin dream --storage-path ./storage --config assistant --dry-run

# Just one task
uv run hugin dream --storage-path ./storage --task assist
```

The dream itself is bounded by `--max-steps` and picks an LLM via `--model`,
exactly like `hugin run`. Because it reuses the existing storage layer, the
same `--storage-path` you pass to a run is what the dream consolidates over —
and what the next run injects from.

## Pruning superseded learnings

Structural supersession removes a replaced learning from active selection but
keeps its artifact as an audit record. Hugin can physically prune those records
after a retention window. The command previews by default:

```bash
# Preview superseded learnings retired for at least 30 days (the default)
uv run hugin prune-learnings --storage-path ./storage

# Choose a different retention window; this still changes nothing
uv run hugin prune-learnings --storage-path ./storage --retention-days 90

# Apply exactly the currently eligible policy
uv run hugin prune-learnings --storage-path ./storage \
  --retention-days 90 --apply
```

The retention clock starts at the superseding learning's creation time, when
the structural retirement was recorded. Only valid, acyclic, exact-scope
supersession links authorize deletion. Age, selection rank, confidence, and
ratings never do. Missing or inconsistent timestamps retain the artifact, and
artifact deletion first removes its owning interaction reference and feedback.

## Seeing the loop work

Set `HUGIN_CAPTURE_RENDERED_PROMPTS=1` on a run and the rendered system prompt
(injection and all) is captured into each `OracleResponse` and visible in the
monitor:

```bash
HUGIN_CAPTURE_RENDERED_PROMPTS=1 uv run hugin run \
  --task assist --task-path examples/dreaming \
  --storage-path ./storage/dreaming

uv run hugin monitor --storage-path ./storage/dreaming
```

That's the audit trail for the closed loop: you can see, turn by turn, exactly
which learnings reached the model.

## Scope

Learnings are **scoped** to where they came from, not global:

- A learning whose source artifacts were produced by config `assistant` is
  injected into future runs of `assistant`. It will not affect any other
  config.
- A learning can be narrowed further to a specific `task`, so it only applies
  when that task is being executed.

This keeps the blast radius of any individual learning small, which matters
because the loop is autonomous — there is no human-in-the-loop step between
"the dream produced this learning" and "the next run sees it in its prompt".

## Guardrails

The autonomy is bounded by three mechanical guardrails, not by approval steps:

- **No dreams-eating-dreams.** Each dream excludes prior `Learning` artifacts
  from its input. Consolidation runs on real experience, not on its own past
  conclusions — otherwise small errors would amplify across cycles.
- **Injection budget.** The selector caps how many learnings can land in a
  prompt. Human ratings become authoritative once present; otherwise the
  dream's self-rating is used, with stable non-recency tie-breaking. This keeps
  prompts bounded without continually evicting older lessons merely because
  newer ones received the same confidence.
- **Scope.** Per-config / per-task scoping keeps a bad learning from
  contaminating unrelated agents.

The dream also self-rates each learning it produces (via `ArtifactFeedback`,
`source="agent"`), creating a fallback quality signal. If humans later rate the
learning, the human average replaces the agent average for selection instead of
being diluted by it, so later human correction can promote or demote a lesson
without competing with its self-rating.
