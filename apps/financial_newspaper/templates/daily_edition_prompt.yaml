name: "daily_edition_prompt"
template: |
  Create today's edition of The Daily Market Herald for {{ edition_date.value }}.

  Target symbols: {{ target_symbols.value | join(', ') }}
  Initial target: {{ number_of_articles.value }} articles (more may be requested later)

  ## WORKFLOW:

  ### STEP 1: Research
  1. Use `fetch_market_news` to survey headlines
  2. Launch `technical_analyst` for technical data:
     ```
     launch_agent(config_name="technical_analyst", task_name="analyze_SYMBOL", task_description="Technical analysis for SYMBOL")
     ```

  ### STEP 2: Write articles
  Use `write_article` for each article. Include technical analysis data (RSI, MACD, etc).

  **NOTE**: `write_article` AUTOMATICALLY sends your article to the editor for review.
  After writing, you will receive editor feedback. Handle it:
  - If approved: continue to next article
  - If rejected: revise based on feedback and rewrite

  ### STEP 3: Finalize (for now)
  After writing {{ number_of_articles.value }} article(s), call `finalize_edition`:
  ```
  finalize_edition(summary="Brief summary of today's edition")
  ```
  This triggers the editor to create the newspaper layout. Note: The user may request additional articles later - the edition can be expanded.

  ## REMINDERS:
  - Get technical analysis BEFORE writing
  - Each `write_article` triggers automatic editor review
  - Use `finalize_edition` when done (NOT `finish`)
  - NEVER launch `financial_journalist` (that's you!)
