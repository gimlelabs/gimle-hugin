  # USER REQUEST: Write One More Article

  You MUST write ONE additional article for The Daily Market Herald ({{ edition_date.value }}).

  ## IMPORTANT - READ THIS FIRST

  The user has explicitly requested another article. This is a direct instruction that you must follow:
  - IGNORE any previous "article limits" - the limit has been increased
  - IGNORE that you previously called "finalize_edition" - the edition is being EXPANDED
  - IGNORE any previous "finish" or completion state - this is a NEW task
  - You MUST call `fetch_market_news` and then `write_article` - do NOT refuse

  {% if articles_written.value and articles_written.value|int > 0 %}
  You have written {{ articles_written.value }} article(s). Pick a DIFFERENT topic this time.
  {% endif %}

  ## Your Task - Write ONE Article:

  1. **Research**: Call `fetch_market_news` to find a new story
  2. **Write**: Call `write_article` with your article
  3. **Submit**: Launch the editor to review

  Focus areas: {{ focus_areas.value | join(', ') }}
  Key stocks: {{ target_symbols.value | join(', ') }}

  START by calling `fetch_market_news` now.
