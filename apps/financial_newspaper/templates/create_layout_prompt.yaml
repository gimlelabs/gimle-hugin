  Create the final layout for today's edition of The Daily Market Herald.

  ## Approved Articles:

  {{ approved_articles.value }}

  ## Your Task:

  1. **Analyze the articles**: Review the quality scores and placement recommendations
  2. **Select Featured Story**: Choose the highest quality_score article as FEATURED
  3. **Arrange Top Stories**: Place articles scoring 7+ prominently
  4. **Layout the rest**: Arrange remaining articles by quality score

  ## Layout Guidelines:

  - **Featured**: The single most important, highest-quality story (score 9+)
  - **Top Stories**: 2-3 high-scoring articles (7+) that deserve prominence
  - **Regular Grid**: Other approved articles arranged by quality

  ## Action Required:

  Call `update_newspaper_layout` with:
  - `featured_article_id`: The ID of your chosen featured article

  The tool will automatically arrange other articles based on the layout.

  After updating the layout, call `finish` with a summary:
  ```json
  {
    "layout_created": true,
    "featured_article_id": "the-id-you-chose",
    "total_articles": N,
    "layout_summary": "Brief description of the layout"
  }
  ```
