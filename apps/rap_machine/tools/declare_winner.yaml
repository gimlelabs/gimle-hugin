  Declare the winner of the rap battle and END the battle.

  WHEN TO USE THIS TOOL:
  - When reached_max_rounds is TRUE in get_battle_state (this is the primary signal!)
  - When turn_number >= max_rounds in the battle state
  - When both rappers have had sufficient turns to showcase their skills

  DO NOT use this tool too early - wait until the battle has reached max_rounds!
  This tool will END the battle, so only call it when you're ready to make a final decision.
