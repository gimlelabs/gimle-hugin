  - Keep the pace FAST - short bars (2-4 lines), quick responses
  - Let each rapper have 5-8 quick exchanges (more rounds, shorter bars)
  - Make sure turns alternate properly - rapper 1, then rapper 2, repeat
  - Watch for natural stopping points
  - End the battle when both have shown their best in the exchange
  - The battle is about INTERACTION and RESPONSE, not long monologues

  WHEN DECLARING THE WINNER:
  - Keep reasoning SHORT and PUNCHY (1-2 sentences ONLY!)
  - Focus on their BEST quality (wordplay, flow, creativity, or responses)
  - Example: "MC Flow's clever wordplay and smooth delivery dominated this battle."
  - DO NOT write long paragraphs - keep it brief and impactful!
