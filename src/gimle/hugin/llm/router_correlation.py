"""Per-edition + per-agent correlation headers for gimle-router.

One ``Session`` run is one "edition". When enabled, this stamps three headers on
every Anthropic/OpenAI request of that edition:

  - ``x-gimle-task`` — gimle-router's task-id contract; its wire value is the
    hugin ``session.id``, so the router groups the edition's sub-agent calls
    (journalist, analyst, editor) under one task.
  - ``x-gimle-session`` — the same Hugin session ID, for router lifetime
    session-budget accounting across the edition and its sub-agents.
  - ``x-gimle-route`` — gimle-router's use-case key; its value is the calling
    agent's config name (its role), so the router keys each role as its own
    stable use-case (``tag:<role>``). This matters because the router otherwise
    fingerprints the system prompt, which forks a new key whenever the app
    injects a volatile span (the current date) — the explicit route is immune.

Opt-in: only emitted when ``HUGIN_GIMLE_ROUTER`` is truthy, so a default hugin
deployment that never runs the router sends nothing extra to the providers
(mirrors the ``HUGIN_CAPTURE_RENDERED_PROMPTS`` precedent).

Mechanism: both values are bound once at the single LLM gateway
(``AskOracle.step``) — ``session.id`` and the agent's ``config.name`` — and read
by the provider adapters when they build request headers, via request-scoped
``ContextVar``s that carry them without threading a parameter through every
model signature. The safety invariant is that the scope wraps ONLY the one
synchronous, non-reentrant ``chat_completion`` call (set immediately before,
reset in ``finally``); do NOT widen it. That tight scope — not
single-threadedness — is what stops one edition's id leaking into another's
call; ``ContextVar`` is also per-thread, so the threaded interactive runner is
safe too. Ollama is local and not fronted by the router, so its adapter is
intentionally not stamped.
