# Add GCP/AWS/Local orchestration scripts

Scripts to run agents on cloud platforms and locally:

- GCP orchestration with Cloud Storage for file storage
- Generalizable to AWS and local (vanilla Linux box)
- GitHub Actions support to run agents or trigger cloud runs

Similar to mimir's orchestration scripts.
