# Add ability to give feedback on artifacts

Introduce the ability for external systems/humans to rated the quality of artifacts - to start with can just be a 1-5 rating.
We need a separate model for this.
Longer term we can use this to train a new reasoning model for a specific set of artifacts, shorter term we should include this in the new and improved artifact querying (another issue)
